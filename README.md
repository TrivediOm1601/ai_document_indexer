# ai_document_indexer
This project is a Rule-based + ML-powered chatbot that helps students query their college rules (like attendance, exams, library, hostel, etc.) using natural language questions.  It combines semantic search (Sentence Transformers + FAISS) with an intent classifier (SVM + embeddings) to provide accurate, context-aware answers.
